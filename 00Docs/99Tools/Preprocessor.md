# Preprocessor operation
The preprocessor combines a header part, a generic part, and a footer part
to synthesize a header file or a c source file. The resulted file type
is selected by file extensions of the header part, the generic part, and the footer part.
Preprocessor operation details are given in a JSON file which is specified in
a command line invoking the preprocessor.
